# Alexa Bank Details Lookup

Validate UK bank details with your voice using Alex and the [GoCardless API](https://developer.gocardless.com).

## Preparing your local environment

1. Install the application's dependencies with `bundle`
2. Make a copy of `.env.example` into `.env`, and fill in your Alexa application ID (obtained when you create your skill [here](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skill/create/)) and your GoCardless access token (created from your Dashboard [here](https://manage.gocardless.com/developers/access-tokens/create)).
3. Run the application with `heroku local` (which will use the included `Procfile`).

## Configuring with Alexa

You can create your Alexa skill on the Amazon site [here](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skill/create/)).

For the intent schema and sample utterances you'll need to provide, see `intent_schema.json` and `sample_utterances.txt`.


## Deploying

This application is ready to deploy to Heroku. Simply create an application, push it up, and set the `GOCARDLESS_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `ALEXA_APPLICATION_ID` environment variables with `heroku config:set`.
